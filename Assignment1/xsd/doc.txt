(DTD vs XML Schema)
Summary:

1. XML Schema is namespace aware, while DTD is not.
2. XML Schemas are written in XML, while DTDs are not.
3. XML Schema is strongly typed, while DTD is not.
4. XML Schema has a wealth of derived and built-in data types that are not available in DTD.
5. XML Schema does not allow inline definitions, while DTD does.

Using the DTD there are some limitations on the description of attribute types and multiplicity.
The Xml Schema allow:
	- to create more precise attributes
	- to create group attributes in case of reuse
	- to create key/keyrefs
	
(Brief Description of Structural Choise)
Refering the Xml Schema: 
the virtualnetworkmanager is the root element, it contains 
	- nffg (from 0 to N)
	- catalog (only one)
	- in (only one)
each nffg contains:
	- node (from 1 to N)
	- link (from 0 to N)
each catalog contains:
	- vnft (from 1 to N)
each in contains:
	- host (from 1 to N)
	- connection (from 0 to N)

The measures of  latency, memory and storage are NonNegativeIntegers.
Atributes are grouped in attributeGroup, for reuse reasons.
The throughput measure is a double restricted to positive values.
